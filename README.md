# General-Hospital-Pre-Triage-Application

(Final Project for OOP245)

Problem:
As a result of the pandemic, there is an increasing number of patients entering hospitals. 
Hospitals need to screen the patients and seperate those in need of COVID-test from others.
This must be done in an orderly fashion by letting the patients know what is the expected
wait time and let them know when they can be admitted.


## The Pre-Triage Application
The application starts by displaying a simple menu with three options:

General Hospital Pre-Triage Application
1- Register
2- Admit
0- Exit
>

## Register
The register option is selected to screen patients before getting into the hospital. The user can select between a COVID Test or Triage.

## Admit
Admit is selected when the COVID Test area or the Triage section is ready to accept a patient.
After selecting COVID or Triage, the patient with the next ticket in line will be called. Based 
on the time of the call, the average wait time for the next patient for that line up (COVID or Triage) will be updated.
